#### Comparison of dt ####

	With dt = 1.41e-3 -> 19.822855
	With dt = 1.269e-3 -> 19.80306
	Ratio is : 19.80306/19.822855 = 0.9990014051961738

	There is no dependency on dt

#### Comparison of dx and dz ####

	With dx, dz= 12.0 -> 19.822855
	With dx, dz = 10.8 -> 13.059519
	Ratio is : 19.82285/13.059519 = 1.51788

	x = log(1.51788) / log(1/0.9/0.9)= 3.96

	%%There is a dependency of 2 for dx and 2 for dz

	We multiply the result by (dx*dz)**2

#### Comparison of vel ####

	With vel*1.0 -> r1 = 19.822855
	With vel*0.9 -> r2 = 19.822853

	Ratio is 19.822855/19.822853 = 0.9999998991063597

	There is NO dependency on the velocity

#### Comparison of v0 ####

	With v0*1.0 -> r1 = 19.822855
	With v0*0.9 -> r2 = 18.600481
	
	Ratio is 19.822855/18.600481 = 1.06572
	
	x = np.log(1.06572)/np.log(1/0.9) = 0.604

	%% There is a dependency of 0.604

	We multiply the result by (V0/2)
